#  How Pool Works
# Liquidity Pool

The Jupiter Perpetuals exchange is a trader-to-LP exchange which means traders borrow tokens from the liquidity pool (the JLP pool) for leverage.
Instead of periodic funding payments between long and short traders, Jupiter Perpetuals implements an hourly borrow fee mechanism.
Traders pay these fees to the pool based on the amount of tokens they've borrowed. This mechanism helps secure the balance of the pool's assets and compensates liquidity providers for the use of their tokens.
