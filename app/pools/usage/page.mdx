# How Pool Works

## Liquidity Pool
## Add/Remove Liquidity
## Yield generation
The exchange generates fees and yields in various ways:

75% of the fees generated by JLP go into the pool. The fees are compounded into the pool hourly.

## Estimated yield

To provide an estimated perspective, you can calculate potential revenue by taking the Jupiter Perpetual Exchange's daily or weekly total volume and multiplying it by a fee percentage. 
For instance:
Total Daily Volume: 50 million Fee Percentage: 0.06%
Price Impact Fees: Minimum 0.01% Revenue Share Percentage: 75%
Using these values (excluding price impact and hourly borrow fees), the estimated calculation would be as follows:
Total estimated revenue to be deposited into the JLP pool:

$50M x 0.06% x 75% = $22,500

To determine your specific share or weight in the total JLP pool, use the following formula:

your_pool_contributed_amount / total_pool_amount x 100 =

your_pool_contributed_amount / total_pool_amount x 100 =


For example:
Your contribution: $1,000
Total pool amount: $4,000,000
Your share percentage: 1,000 / 4,000,000 x 100 = 0.025%

Finally, you can calculate your estimated generated revenue share by multiplying the results of the first and second calculations:
estimated revenue share you generate = $22,500 x 0.025% = $5.625


## Fee distribution and APY calculation

### Fee Distribution

**1) Hourly Fee Distribution**

Fee distribution into the JLP token occurs at the start of every hour, in UTC (e.g. 00:00 UTC, 01:00 UTC, 02:00 UTC and so on).

During this process, 75% of realised fees are withdrawn from each custody account's assets, fees_reserves and deposited back into the pool, while the remaining 25% is sent to Jupiter as a protocol fee.

###  Weekly APR Updates

The JLP pool maintains a pool_apr.last_updated field, which records a UNIX timestamp of the latest APR update. After a **consecutive week** of hourly fee distributions has passed, Jupiter calculates the new APR and updates the

pool_apr.fee_apr_bps value accordingly.

**APR Calculation**

APR for the JLP pool is updated weekly and can be calculated using the following formula:


## Risks

### 1. Bull Markets

During a bull market, JLP may not outperform SOL, ETH, or BTC. This is because the pool is made of a mix of stable and non-stable tokens.

### 2. Profit and Loss (PnL) Dynamics
