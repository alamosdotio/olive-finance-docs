# Mission

The very short term mission of is to let users trade options, futures and other exotic dervatives on solana.

The long term mission of olive is to let users trade anything.

In olive finance we have 6 missions, we will try to execute them in order from 1 to 6:

mission #1: Build decentralized derivates that source liquidity from one pool. For example we will have a SOL/USDC pool that sells futures, options, and other exotic derivatives to traders. This way there is more liquidity for traders and more consistent yield for the market makers. This type of liquidity is backed by assets that always make sure that the position is covered.

mission #2: This is the same as the first mission but now our pools are not asset backed. The liquidity pool sells derivatives on equities, bonds, commodities and forex. The profits are capped. The prices are taken from pyth oracle.

mission #3: Build a thorough prediction markets that includes sports, politics, markets, science, etc...

mission #4: Build an NFT market that also lets you trade NFT options.

mission #5: Build an AMM that allows people to make multi-asset pools with their weight of choice.

mission #6: Once mission 1-5 is done. people can trade pretty much anything. So the only thing that will be left to trade will be other wallets. You can copy trade the best wallets. The best performing wallets will be ranked.
